# Youtube-Replica

Well this is just me starting my journey in coding.
I did this project for me to better understand and learn new properties and elements as beginner.

This is a youtube replica/clone I made after the tutorial I took from Supersimpledev my first project

I uploaded it here in the hopes that I might be able to come back in the future and make some additional changes/improvement as I learn.

I understood the importance of using the right semantic element and synthax when writing my code.

position property 
flex property
grid property and more...

I'm open to learning more and working with likeminds on projects as I try to enhance my knowledge on coding.
